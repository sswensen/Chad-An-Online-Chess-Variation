                                    Rooks and queens move unimpeded by castles and walls.

                                <li>
                                    The king can move and capture in the same way as a chess king or knight

                                    A rook or queen may capture an opponent's rook or queen only when one of these pieces is
                                    on the enemy's wall, and the other piece is in its own castle. This is the only scenario
                                    in which rooks and queens can capture.

                                    In other situations rooks and queens cannot capture, and simply block one another's
                                    movement.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Castle walls do not block check
                                </li>
                                <li>
